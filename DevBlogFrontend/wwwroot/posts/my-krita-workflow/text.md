I use Krita mostly for helping me out with coding, creating custom images to work with. For this purpose I want to be able to quickly draw some simple shapes and be able to look at those with different zoom levels at the same time.

## Setup Krita

### Fix pressure sensitivity (if necessary)

Go to `Settings` > `Configure Krita` > `Tablet settings` and set `Tablet input API` to `Windows Ink`.

### Enable showing multiple views side by side

Go to `Settings` > `Configure Krita` > `General` > `Window` and set `Multiple Document Mode` to `Subwindows`.

## Use Krita

### Show multiple views side by side

1. Go to `Window` > `New View` and select your view for which you want another one.
2. Go to `Window` and select `Tile` to show the views side by side.
