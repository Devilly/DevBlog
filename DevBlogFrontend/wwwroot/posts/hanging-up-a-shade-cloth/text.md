To give our back garden some shade in times when the sun is killing, especially for the children, we put up a shade cloth.

Even though it is quite a simple setup it took me some time to get it right. Some points of interest:
1. The two balks of timber on the right are placed in holes about ⅓ the height of the balks themselves and are placed oblique to the outside as to enable more stability when the cloth gets caught by the wind.
1. The single balk on the left is attached to the fence with corner brackets put inside out and put into the ground somewhat less than ⅓ of its height, hoping the fence will give enough reinforcement.
1. The cloth is attached to a metal chain by means of a screw link.
1. On the other end the chain is attached to a screw eye in the balk by means of a carabiner.

The way the cloth is attached to the balks makes it really easy to hang it up and take down again.
